# TUSD-Vex-Example-Repository

This is the TUSD example code repository. Each "level" of code stands for the level of complexity that is incorporated into the example programs. In each level, we go over the different coding concepts and languages that would be used relative to the knowledge and understanding of someone at that level. Read the README.md files within each level for a more detailed description of the concepts used.

# Understanding the Code

All of the examples within this repository are written for a tank drive chassis, lift, and claw robot. Keep this in mind when looking at the code.
